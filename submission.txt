Here is the link to my project one. I sent additional information to your email.
https://morganlee123.github.io/PHY215Atmospheres/

The page consists of three modules

1. New weather forecasting physics in the Global Forecasting System
2. Spectrographic readings for determining habitability of other planets
3. Climate modeling to learn more about our impact on planet Earth

The first module is implemented to meet the requirements of project 1. The last two will be implemented by project 2.

If you have any questions or clarifications you'd like to be made. Please reach out to me at sandle20@msu.edu

Thanks,
Morgan
